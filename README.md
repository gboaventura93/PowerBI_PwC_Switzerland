# PowerBI_PwC_Switzerland
I took this course on Forage that focused on the purpose and goals of the Digital Accelerator program.

This course had three tasks:
1. Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered
