# PowerBI_PwC_Switzerland
I took this course at theforage.com that focused on the purpose and goals of the Digital Accelerator program.

This course had three tasks:
1. Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):
  - Overall customer satisfaction;
  - Overall calls answered/abandoned;
  - Calls by time;
  - Average speed of answer;
  - Agentâ€™s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered.

2. Define proper KPIs and create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs.
